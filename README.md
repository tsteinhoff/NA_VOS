Underway pCO2 measurements onboard the North Atlantic VOS line

For the last 12 years the CO2 group at [GEOMAR](https://www.geomar.de/forschen/fb2/fb2-ch/arbeitsgruppen/team-oco/#c25570) operates underway measurements onboard a voluntary observing ship (VOS9 crossing the North Atlantic Ocean between UK and Canada.

In 2018 our intruments will be installed onboard one of the [ACL](https:www.aclcargo.com) new cargo vessels.   
The preparations will be described in a [Wiki](https://github.com/tsteinhoff/NA_VOS/wiki/Lab-preparations).
